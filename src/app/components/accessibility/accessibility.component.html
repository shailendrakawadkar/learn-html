      <h1>Web Accessibility</h1>
      <p>Web accessibility refers to the practice of making websites and web applications usable by people with disabilities. This includes those who use assistive technologies such as screen readers, magnifiers, and speech recognition software.</p>
      <h2>Accessibility Guidelines</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Provide alternative text for images and other non-text content</li>
        <li>Use semantic HTML elements and ARIA roles</li>
        <li>Provide clear and consistent navigation</li>
        <li>Ensure that all functionality is available through a keyboard</li>
        <li>Use sufficient color contrast</li>
        <li>Provide captions and transcripts for audio and video content</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Accessibility Example</h2>
      <div class="code-block">
        <pre>
          <code class="language-html">
  &lt;button aria-label="Submit Form"&gt;Submit&lt;/button&gt;
  &lt;img src="example.jpg" alt="A photo of a dog sitting on a porch"&gt;
  &lt;label for="email"&gt;Email:&lt;/label&gt;
  &lt;input type="email" id="email"&gt;
          </code>
        </pre>
      </div>
      <p>In this example, we have used the <code>aria-label</code> attribute to provide an accessible label for the button element, the <code>alt</code> attribute to provide alternative text for the image, and the <code>for</code> and <code>id</code> attributes to associate the label with the input field. These techniques help to make the webpage more accessible for users with disabilities who rely on assistive technologies.</p>
      <p>By following web accessibility guidelines, we can ensure that websites and web applications are usable by as many people as possible, including those with disabilities. This can lead to increased engagement and conversions, as well as legal and social benefits.
