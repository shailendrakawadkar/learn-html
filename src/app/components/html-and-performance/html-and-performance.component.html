        <h1>HTML and Performance</h1>
        <p>Website performance is critical for providing a good user experience and improving the visibility of a
            website in search engines. There are several factors that can impact the performance of a website, including
            the size and complexity of the HTML code.</p>
        <h2>Improving HTML Performance</h2>
        <p>Here are a few ways to improve the performance of your HTML code:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Minimize the number of elements and attributes in your HTML code. Every element and attribute that is
                added to the page increases the size of the HTML code and the number of DOM elements that the browser
                has to process.</li>
            <li>Use semantic HTML elements. Semantic elements, such as 'header', 'nav', 'article', and 'footer', provide
                additional meaning to the content and can make it easier for search engines and assistive technologies
                to understand the structure of the page.</li>
            <li>Remove unnecessary whitespace and comments. Whitespace and comments increase the size of the HTML code
                and can slow down the parsing and rendering of the page.</li>
            <li>Use a CSS preprocessor to write and maintain your CSS code. CSS preprocessors, such as Sass and Less,
                provide additional features, such as variables and mixins, that can make it easier to write and maintain
                your CSS code.</li>
            <li>Minimize the number of HTTP requests by using techniques such as image sprites and inlining small images
                and scripts.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>By following these best practices, you can improve the performance of your HTML code and provide a better
            user experience for your visitors.</p>
