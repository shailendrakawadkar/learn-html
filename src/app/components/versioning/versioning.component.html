      <h1>Versioning</h1>
      <p>Versioning is the process of assigning version numbers to software releases in order to identify and track changes made to the software over time. Proper versioning is important to ensure that users are aware of the latest updates and that they can revert to previous versions if necessary.</p>
      <h2>Versioning Best Practices</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Use a consistent versioning scheme (e.g. major.minor.patch) </li>
        <li>Increase the major version number for significant changes or breaking changes</li>
        <li>Increase the minor version number for new features or improvements</li>
        <li>Increase the patch version number for bug fixes and minor changes</li>
        <li>Include release notes with each version to inform users of the changes made</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Versioning Example</h2>
      <div class="code-block">
        <pre>
          <code class="language-html">
  &lt;!-- In this example, the version number is "1.2.3" --&gt;
  &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="styles-1.2.3.css"&gt;
  &lt;script src="script-1.2.3.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
          </code>
        </pre>
      </div>
      <p>In this example, we are using a consistent versioning scheme with three digits: major, minor and patch. The version number is "1.2.3" and it is represented in the name of CSS and JavaScript files. This approach allows users to easily identify the version of the software they are using and upgrade to the latest version as needed. Additionally, by including release notes with each version, users can be informed of the changes made and decide if they want to upgrade or not.
