      <h1>Tooling</h1>
      <p>Tooling refers to the use of tools and technologies to help with the development, testing, and deployment of software. Proper tooling is important to streamline the development process, improve the quality of the software, and automate repetitive tasks.</p>
      <h2>Tooling Best Practices</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Use version control systems such as Git to track changes to the codebase</li>
        <li>Use task runners such as Grunt or Gulp to automate repetitive tasks</li>
        <li>Use build tools such as Webpack or Browserify to bundle and minify code</li>
        <li>Use a linter such as ESLint to catch syntax and style errors</li>
        <li>Use testing frameworks such as Jest or Mocha to test the code</li>
        <li>Use a package manager such as npm or yarn to manage dependencies</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Tooling Example</h2>
      <div class="code-block">
        <pre>
          <code class="language-javascript">
  // Use Git for version control
  $ git init
  $ git add .
  $ git commit -m "Initial commit"
  
  // Use npm for package management
  $ npm init
  $ npm install --save-dev webpack
  
  // Use Webpack for building and bundling
  const path = require('path');
  const webpack = require('webpack');
  
  module.exports = {{'{'}}
    entry: './src/index.js',
    output: {{'{'}}
      path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
      filename: 'bundle.js'
    {{'}'}},
    plugins: [
      new webpack.optimize.UglifyJsPlugin()
    ]
  {{'}'}};
          </code>
        </pre>
      </div>
      <p>In this example, we are using Git for version control, npm for package management, and Webpack for building and bundling. By using Git, we can track changes to the codebase and collaborate with other developers. Using npm, we can easily manage dependencies and automate the process of installing and updating them. Webpack allows us to bundle and minify our code for production, improving the performance and load time of our application. By using these tools and technologies, we can streamline the development process, improve the quality of the software, and automate repetitive tasks.
