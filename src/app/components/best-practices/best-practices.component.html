      <h2>HTML Best Practices</h2>

        <li>Keep it simple: Keep the HTML structure of your webpage as simple as possible. Avoid using too many nested elements or unnecessary elements.</li>
        <li>Use proper indentation: Use proper indentation to make the structure of your HTML code more readable and easier to understand.</li>
        <li>Use meaningful class and id names: Use meaningful class and id names to make it easier to style elements with CSS and to make the code more readable.</li>
        <li>Use alt attributes for images: Use the alt attribute to provide a text description for images. This is important for accessibility and for search engines.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>CSS Best Practices</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Use a CSS reset: Use a CSS reset to remove the default styling of elements and ensure consistency across different browsers.</li>
        <li>Use a CSS preprocessor: Use a CSS preprocessor such as SASS or LESS to make it easier to maintain and scale your CSS code.</li>
        <li>Use a CSS framework: Use a CSS framework such as Bootstrap or Foundation to quickly create a responsive and consistent layout for your webpage.</li>
        <li>Use CSS selectors effectively: Use CSS selectors effectively to target specific elements and avoid using too many specific selectors.</li>
