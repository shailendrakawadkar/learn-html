        <h1>HTML Email</h1>
        <p>HTML email is the use of HTML and CSS to create and format the content of an email. It allows for greater
            design flexibility and the ability to include interactive elements such as images, links, and buttons.
            However, it also requires a greater understanding of HTML and CSS, as email clients often have limited
            support for certain features.</p>
        <h2>HTML Email Best Practices</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Use a responsive design to ensure that the email looks good on any device</li>
            <li>Use tables for layout and CSS for styling</li>
            <li>Use inline CSS to ensure that the styles are applied consistently across email clients</li>
            <li>Test the email on multiple email clients and devices</li>
            <li>Keep the code simple and clean to ensure maximum compatibility</li>
        </ul>

        <p>In this example, we have used a table for the layout and inline CSS for styling. The email is designed to be
            responsive and will adjust to the size of the device it is being viewed on. We have also used a simple,
            clean code to ensure maximum compatibility across email clients. By testing the email on multiple email
            clients and devices, we can ensure that the email looks good and functions correctly for all recipients.
            Additionally, by keeping the code simple and clean, we can minimize the risk of the email being flagged as
            spam or having elements of the design not render correctly on certain email clients. HTML email allows for
            greater design flexibility and the ability to include interactive elements, however it also requires a
            greater understanding of HTML and CSS and testing to ensure that the email looks good and functions
            correctly for all recipients.
