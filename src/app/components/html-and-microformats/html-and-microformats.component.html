        <h1>HTML and Microformats</h1>
        <p>Microformats are a set of open standards for marking up structured data within HTML code. They provide a way
            to embed additional information about the content on a web page, such as contact information, events, and
            reviews, in a way that is both human- and machine-readable.</p>
        <h2>Using Microformats in HTML</h2>
        <p>Microformats use standard HTML classes to define the properties of an item. For example, to mark up an event
            using the hCalendar microformat, we can use the following code:</p>
        <div class="code-block">
            <pre>
          <code class="language-html">
  &lt;div class="vevent"&gt;
    &lt;a class="url" href="event.html"&gt;Event Name&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;span class="dtstart"&gt;2022-05-01&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="location"&gt;Event Location&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
          </code>
        </pre>
        </div>
        <p>In this example, we have a 'div' element with the 'vevent' class that defines the item as an event. Inside
            the 'div', we have several elements with classes such as 'url', 'dtstart', and 'location' that specify the
            properties of the event such as the event name, start date, and location. </p>
        <p>By using microformats, you can help search engines and other software understand the content and context of
            the page, which can improve the visibility of the page in search results and enable new features and
            functionality. Additionally, you may also consider using a microformat parser to extract the structured data
            from your page for use in other applications.</p>
